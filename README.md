## statement of problem
what is the boolean expression of the statement
  "it is possible to make a path from start to treasure"

## recursive abstraction
######Version L

[From Treasure to Player, backwards]

When I'm asked to 
find a path to treasure,
the recursive abtraction can 
find a path to a new nearer "treasure", which is a legal spot that is immediately next to the original treasure. 
######Version C

[From Player to Treasure, forwards]

When I am asked for the solution(s) of a maze,
and I am n steps into the maze,
the recursive abstraction can find the n+1 step, and the
rest until I reach the end of the maze.

Will pick one/combine later after discussion in person
